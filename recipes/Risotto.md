# Diogo's lazy Mushroom Risotto
Risotto is that fancy dish that tastes good and makes you look good, but ain't any complex culinary masterpiece.

## Ingredients
- Risotto rice (gotta be risotto rice, otherwise it won't be the right consistency!)
- Vegetable stock (you can get those seasoning cubes / do your own stock / or buy it in a packet)
- White mushrooms
- White wine
- Onions
- Butter
- Coriander
- Cheese
Note: Not giving measurements, because it is up to you how much you like / want and ingredient 

## Instructions
- Put olive oil on a frying pan and put it on the stove
- Slice onion and mushrooms
- Add to the pan and leave it there until the onion is golden-is and the mushrooms shrunk (add wine as you like)
- Add rice (as much as you want) and let it toast for bit
- Add the stock and start adding water - keep on adding water until the rice is cooked
- To finish add as you like: butter, chopped coriander and cheese

Voila!
